## Perform these steps and write the output of commands when asked to:

1. make
2. touch main
3. make
  * output?
4. touch foo.h
5. make
  * output?
6. touch foo.o
7. make
  * output?
8. touch main.c
9. make
  * output?
10. touch foo.c
11. make main.o
  * output?


### Note: It is not important to get the output verbatim, rather it is important to know what steps will take place with each 'make'.
