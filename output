The memory address of global variable globalvar is 0x602050
The memory address of static variable staticvar is 0x602058

The memory address of local variable a is 0x7fff0e504748
The memory address of local variable b is 0x7fff0e50474c

The memory address of heap variable c is 0x776010
The memory address of heap variable d is 0x776030

The memory address of the function add is 0x400832
The memory address of the function multiply is 0x40087b

Ok, now let's try to add, by asking the operate function to use the add function...
  (inside operate) Storing into 0x776010 results of operation at memory address 0x400832
    (inside add) Adding the contents of 0x7fff0e504748 and 0x7fff0e50474c. (4+3)
The contents of malloc'd space 0x776010, "c", is 7

Ok, now let's try to multiply, by asking the operate function to use the multiply function...
  (inside operate) Storing into 0x602050 results of operation at memory address 0x40087b
    (inside multiply) Multiplying the contents of 0x7fff0e504748 and 0x7fff0e50474c. (4*3)
The contents of global variable 0x602050, "globalvar", is 12
