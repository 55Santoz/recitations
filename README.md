This repository contains the recitation notes for Columbia's Advanced
Programming Class, COMSW3157, as taught by Jae Woo Lee. For more information
about the class, visit the [course homepage](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/3157).

These recitations are held weekly by the various TAs, generally using these
notes as the basis for their sections. Issues, patches, and comments, especially
by current and former students, are welcome.

Contents:

* [Recitation 1](recitation-1.md): Introduction to UNIX, compile your first C
  program. Be sure to have a CLIC account from CRF before the recitation.
* [Recitation 2](recitation-2.md): Makefiles. Bitwise operations. Configuring
  and using Git for version control and file tracking.
    * You may find the [sample-Makefile](sample-Makefile) a useful reference.
    * See also the Recitation 2 practice exercise, under
      [practice/recitation-2/](practice/recitation-2/)
* [Recitation 3](recitation-3.md): C Basics: data types, complex expressions and statements.
* [Recitation 4](recitation-4.md): Pointers, arrays, and heap memory 
(i.e. malloc).
    * See also the very useful [recitation-6-code](recitation-6-code/) directory,
      especially `pointerfun.c` and its output `pointerfun-output` for some
      interesting experiments with pointers and memory addresses.
* [Recitation 5](recitation-5.md): Function pointers. Taking Makefiles to the
  next level. File input/output.
* [Recitation 6](recitation-6.md): The UNIX stack. Users, permissions, file

      directory for a fun example of forking.
* [Recitation 7](recitation-7.md): `size_t`. File IO, including reading, writing,
  and seeking in files.
* [Recitation 8](recitation-8.md): Midterm(s) review.
* [Recitation 10](recitation-10.md): C++. Classes/Structs. Stack vs heap allocation
