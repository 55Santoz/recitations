This repository contains the recitation notes for Columbia's Advanced
Programming Class, COMSW3157, as taught by Jae Woo Lee. For more information
about the class, visit the [course homepage](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/3157).

These recitations are held weekly by the various TAs, generally using these
notes as the basis for their sections. Issues, patches, and comments, especially
by current and former students, are welcome.

Contents:

* [Recitation 1](recitation-1.md): Introduction to UNIX, compile your first C
  program. Be sure to have a CLIC account from CRF before the recitation.
* [Recitation 2](recitation-2.md): C Basics. Using Make. Bits, bytes, and data types!
    * You may find the [sample-Makefile](sample-Makefile) a useful reference.
    * See also the Recitation 2 practice exercise, under
      [practice/recitation-2/](practice/recitation-2/)
* [Recitation 3](recitation-3.md): git! Configure your git, status of files,
  committing and modifying, and undoing changes.
* [Recitation 4](recitation-4.md): Complex expressions and statements. Pointers,
  arrays, and heap memory (ie malloc).
    * See also the very useful [recitation-6-code](recitation-6-code/) directory,
      especially `pointerfun.c` and its output `pointerfun-output` for some
      interesting experiments with pointers and memory addresses.
* [Recitation 5](recitation-5.md): Function pointers. Taking Makefiles to the
  next level. File input/output.

      directory for a fun example of forking.
* [Recitation 7](recitation-7.md): size_t. File IO, including reading, writing,
  and seeking in files.
